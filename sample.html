      <p>Now that we have our shell we can start writing our actual plugin code. But before we do that, I'd like to say a word about context. In the immediate scope of the plugin function, the this keyword refers to the jQuery object the plugin was invoked on. This is a common slip up due to the fact that in other instances where jQuery accepts a callback, the this keyword refers to the native DOM element. This often leads to developers unnecessarily wrapping the this keyword (again) in the jQuery function.</p>
